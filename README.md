# IL6 Gene Sequence Analysis

# Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive sequence analysis of the human IL6 gene. The analysis was performed using various bioinformatics tools to explore the gene's structure, function, and regulation. The steps involved in this analysis include downloading the sequence, translating it, identifying open reading frames (ORFs), analyzing sequence composition, identifying transcription factor binding sites, searching for functional motifs, predicting coding or non-coding regions, and converting sequence file formats.
